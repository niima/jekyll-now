# My personal Blog

After years of using wordpress `'the shitty'` blog platform, i decided to move to github pages and jekyll instead.

follow it at [niima.github.io](https://niima.github.io) or view my home page at [niima.net](https://niima.net)
 

if you want your own static github-hosted easy to start blog, [Fork jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and start blogging!
